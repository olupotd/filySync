filySync
========

A fileSync application developed in Java for Backing up your files and folders. Optimized for better performance..

I was using Dropbox and still use Dropbox. I also truct dropbox but sometimes I may not have an internet connection and still need to backup my files automatically. YES i do know there are applications that do that but sometimes you need that cutting edge setting that just makes that application seem like it was designed for you specifically. 

That is what modivated me to start this project and it took me a week to build the application up to it's current state. 
It's currently functional and running on my computer. I'll be putting the source code up soon but as of now, I seem to have some clients around and well, I might just take advantage of that situation if you understand what i mean.
